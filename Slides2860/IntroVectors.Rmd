# Atomic Vectors

## Types of Vectors

Vectors are the basic building blocks of data and programming in `R`. There are two types of vectors: **atomic vectors** and **lists**.

* There are six types of **atomic vectors** in R. 
* Atomic vectors can only contain elements of the same type. 
* A **factor** or **date-time** is a special (*augmented*) atomic vector.
* The **list** structure is sometimes called a recursive vector.
* Lists can contain different types of data, including other lists.
* A **data frame** or **tibble** is a special (*augmented*) type of list.

**`NULL`** is the absence of a vector and it essentially behaves like a vector of length 0. We will see this in different contexts.


## The Six Types of Atomic Vectors

| typeof (...)                           | mode (...) | storage.mode (...) |
|:--------------------------------------:|:----------:|:------------------:|
| logical (`TRUE` = `1` / `FALSE` = `0`) | logical    | logical            |
| integer                                | numeric    | integer            |
| double                                 | numeric    | double*            |
| complex                                | complex    | complex            |
| character (alphanumeric, string)       | character  | character          |
| raw (contains raw bytes)               | raw        | raw                |

\* double precision floating point (a method by which computers store decimal numbers; 64 bits or 8 bytes of memory)

## Identify Vector Structure

If there is more than one data type when a vector is created, the function converts all the elements to the lowest possible type.

Several functions can help us identify vector structure. The two below are particularly useful.

`typeof()` --- determines the internal storage mode of an object

`class()` --- determines the `class` attributes of an object, which are related to the way the object is handled when programming (e.g., what `R` functions can be used and what operations can be performed on that object)

*Example:* We can add numeric vectors using the `+` operator, but we cannot add character vectors.


# Creating Vectors

## The `vector()` Function

We can create any type of atomic vector or list with the vector function (plus a few other forms). The syntax (*note the default parameter values*) is shown below.

    vector(mode = "logical", length = 0)
    
```{r}
# using default parameter values; "parameters" are function settings
vector()
# changing mode and length
vector(mode = "numeric", length = 10) # vector is filled with zeroes
```


##

```{r}
vector(mode = "logical", length = 5) # recall that FALSE = 0
vector(mode = "integer", length = 6) # filled with zeroes
vector(mode = "double", length = 7) # filled with zeroes
vector(mode = "character", length = 8) # empty character spaces
```


## 

In addition to the `vector()` function, there are related functions to create each of the different types of atomic vectors. Default is length zero, like `vector()`.

    logical(length = 0)
    integer(length = 0)
    double(length = 0)
    numeric(length = 0)
    character(length = 0)
    
```{r}
logical(length = 10)
character(length = 10)
```


## The `c()` Function

The c in the `c()` function is short for *concatenate* or *combine*. It is a general function that structures its arguments---*the values you put inside the parentheses*---into a vector. 

```{r}
c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)   # logical vector
```

```{r}
c(10, 2, 78, 5, 16)   # numeric vector
```

```{r}
c("Alex", "Drew", "Jordan", "Riley")   # character vector
```


## Vector Storage

To store the vector as an object we can use in programming, we need to use the ***assignment operator*** `<-`. A shortcut is `Alt` + `-`.

```{r}
logicalvector <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
```

```{r}
numericvector <- c(10, 2, 78, 5, 16)
```

```{r}
charactervector <- c("Alex", "Drew", "Jordan", "Riley")
```

Examine the vector objects in your Environment pane! We also can recall the contents by typing its "name" in the Console.

```{r}
logicalvector
```


# Coercing Vectors

## Mixing Elements in c()

For a mix of element types, vector type (mode) is determined by ***implicit coercion*** to the lowest possible type.

```{r}
v1 <- c(10, TRUE, 0.5) # integer, logical, and numeric elements
v1   # notice that TRUE has been expressed as its numeric form 1
```

```{r}
typeof(v1)   # the storage mode of the vector
class(v1)    # the object class of the vector
```


##

```{r}
v2 <- c("A", 10, TRUE, 0.5) # now add a character element
v2   # notice the quotation marks around all the elements
```

```{r}
typeof(v2)
class(v2)
```

<hr>

recall the hierarchical order: 

<div style = "text-align: center;">`logical` > `integer` > `double` > `complex` > `character`</div>


## Forcing a Change

We can purposely change or coerce vector types using the `as.*` functions. This is called ***explicit coercion***. 

* `as.logical()`
* `as.integer()`
* `as.double()`
* `as.character()`

We rarely use `complex` vectors (i.e., imaginary numbers) in data science, but there is a function for that as well.

Explicit coercion depends on the specific elements in the vector. We cannot force a character vector to become a numeric vector, for example. As we will see later, `as.Date()` is a useful coercion, too. All these are useful for cleaning messy data.


## Some Examples

```{r}
v3 <- c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
typeof(v3)
```

```{r}
v4 <- as.integer(v3)
typeof(v4)
```

```{r}
v5 <- as.character(v3)
typeof(v5)
```


## What is Happening?

```{r}
as.numeric(v2)
```

```{r}
as.integer(v2)
```

```{r}
as.logical(v3)
```

```{r}
as.logical(v5)
```
