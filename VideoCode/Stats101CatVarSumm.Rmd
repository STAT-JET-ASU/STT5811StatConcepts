## Packages Used

```{r loadpackages}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Smartphone User Example

### Read in the Dataset 

The data is in a CSV file stored on the web, so we will read it into RStudio using `read_csv()` from the tidyverse package (which has been loaded above). It is always good to inspect the structure of a dataset, especially if you have not used it before.

```{r readdata}
URL <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT-JET-ASU/Datasets/master/Stats101/stats101smartphones.csv"
smartphones <- read_csv(URL)
```

```{r datastructure}
# glimpse the structure
glimpse(smartphones)
# see the first six rows
head(smartphones)
```

### Make `brand` a Factor

We can convert `brand` into a factor variable so the categories are ordered the way we want.

```{r}
# extract and alphabetize the category names
sortedcats <- sort(unique(smartphones$brand))
sortedcats

# move the 'Other' category to the end
# you need to switch positions 5 and 6
# indices [i] are the vector locations
categories <- c(sortedcats[1:4], sortedcats[6], sortedcats[5])
categories

# you could also manually type the order, since this is a short vector
# however, big picture, manual inputs in code are not very reproducible
# categories <- c("Apple", "HTC", "LG", "Motorola", "Samsung", "Other")
# mutate into a factor variable
smartphones <- smartphones %>%
  mutate(brand = factor(brand, levels = categories))

# check structure, now brand is a <fct> versus <chr>
glimpse(smartphones)
```

### Frequency Distribution

Most methods for creating frequency distributions in `R` do not automatically add the totals, since we may want to use the "table" in further operations. We can use other methods to calculate totals. Because we are using the **dplyr** package function `count()`, the output will be a tibble. This is useful because we can easily perform other operations on it.

```{r}
# count observations in each brand
smartphones %>%
  count(brand)

# find total number of observations
smartphones %>%
  count(brand) %>%
  summarize(total = sum(n))
```

A better way to do this would be to save the frequency distribution as an object to avoid redundant coding.

```{r}
# count observations in each brand
# save the results for use later
# the results are a new dataset
# print it to see the counts
phonedist1 <- smartphones %>%
  count(brand)
phonedist1

# get total from the saved counts
# they are stored in the n column
phonedist1 %>%
  summarize(total = sum(n))
```

### Frequency Bar Plot

#### Bare-Bones Bar Plot

If you are exploring your data, you can make a quick and simple plot like the one below.

```{r}
# basic barplot of brand from raw data
ggplot(smartphones, aes(x = brand)) +
  geom_bar()
```

#### Formatted Bar Plot

If you are presenting your data, you should at least add a title and better axis labels. This plot is formatted to resemble the one in the video by changing the bar colors, bar widths, y-axis scaling/numbering, and removing some grid lines. Colors can be specified using names, hex codes, or RGB codes. The function `colors()` will show you what color names `R` recognizes.

```{r}
ggplot(smartphones, aes(x = brand)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "darkorange", width = 0.5) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 50, by = 5)) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Smartphone Ownership",
    x = "Brand of Phone",
    y = "Frequency"
  ) +
  theme(
    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank()
  )
```

#### Using the "Table"

You can also make a bar plot from your saved frequency distribution object using `geom_col()`. This plot can be formatted in the same way as the one above, which is one major advantage of using ggplot2.

```{r}
# basic barplot of brand from saved counts
ggplot(phonedist1, aes(x = brand, y = n)) +
  geom_col()
```

### Relative Fequencies

```{r}
smartphones %>%
  count(brand) %>%
  mutate(rel_freq = prop.table(n))
```

We also could have used the distribution we saved above to avoid re-typing the same code. You should think about these kinds of things when planning your workflow. We can also rename `n` to be `frequency`.

```{r}
phonedist2 <- phonedist1 %>%
  mutate(rel_freq = prop.table(n)) %>%
  rename(frequency = n)
phonedist2

phonedist2 %>%
  summarize(
    total_frequency = sum(frequency),
    total_rel_freq = sum(rel_freq)
  )
```

### Relative Frequency Bar Plot

#### Bare-Bones Bar Plot

We have to instruct ggplot2 to compute relative frequencies from the data.

```{r}
ggplot(smartphones, aes(x = brand)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = (..count..) / sum(..count..)))
```

#### Formatted Bar Plot

If you are presenting your data, you should at least add a title and better axis labels. This plot is formatted to resemble the one in the video by changing the colors, bar widths, y-axis numbering, and the grid lines.

```{r}
ggplot(smartphones, aes(x = brand)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = (..count..) / sum(..count..)),
    fill = "darkorange",
    width = 0.5
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 0.5, by = 0.1)) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Smartphone Ownership",
    x = "Brand of Phone",
    y = "Relative Frequency"
  ) +
  theme(
    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank()
  )
```

#### Using the "Table"

Again, you can also make a bar plot from your saved frequency distribution object using `geom_col()`.

```{r}
ggplot(phonedist2, aes(x = brand, y = rel_freq)) +
  geom_col()
```
