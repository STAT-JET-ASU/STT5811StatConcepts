## Greetings!

Welcome to STT 5811 Statistical Concepts and Applications with Dr. Jill Thomley. To prepare for the start of our exciting journey...

* Log on to [AsULearn](https://asulearn.appstate.edu/)!

* Find and open the link "STT 5811 Spring 2026 Syllabus"

* Find and open the link "Course Introduction S26 Slides"

* Begin to familiarize yourself with the course documents and our AsULearn site. AsULearn is the vital hub of our course for assignments and communication.

We will do some activities to make sure we are set up on course technology and familiar with course structure / expectations.

## Motivating Philosophies

[Mathematics Master of Arts (MA)](https://www.appstate.edu/academics/graduate/id/mathematics-ma): "App State's Master of Arts in Mathematics is designed to prepare you to teach mathematics and impart its importance to the next generation."

This preparation also includes **introductory statistics**, which is commonly taught at community colleges.

From the [2025 revision to the American Statistical Association's GAISE College Report](https://amstat.quarto.pub/college-gaise/) ...

"Introductory statistics courses serve as students’ first formal encounter with statistical thinking and methodology. These courses should emphasize the statistical process while building conceptual understanding that prepares students for advanced study or informed citizenship."


## GAISE Student Learning Outcomes

<ol>
<li>Identify cases, variables, and types of variables in data sets, including multivariable data sets.</li>
<li>Explain how study design affects what conclusions can be drawn from the data. In particular, explain the importance of random sampling and random assignment.</li>
<li>Identify and interpret appropriate graphs and summary statistics in both univariate and multivariate settings.</li>
<li>Use statistical software or apps to create visualizations, produce summary statistics, and carry out the computational aspects of statistical analysis.</li>
<li>Articulate the role that random variation plays in statistical inference. In particular, articulate its role in generalizing from a sample to a population.</li>
</ol>

##

<ol start = "6">
<li>Identify the key methods to use in statistical inference and interpret results from those methods.</li> 
<li>Recognize that sampling variation is one reason that conclusions drawn from statistical inference might be incorrect, and that replication and reproducibility are important to verify conclusions.</li>
<li>Use statistical models, such as linear regression, for prediction.</li>
<li>Recognize ethical issues and dilemmas in statistical practice.</li>
<li>Communicate, clearly and in context, results obtained from data.</li>
</ol>


## GAISE Recommendations

The following pedagogical [recommendations](https://amstat.quarto.pub/college-gaise/recommendations.html) are designed to support instructors in creating courses that enable students to achieve the GAISE student learning outcomes.

<ol>
<li>Teach statistics and data science as processes of gleaning insights from data to inform evidence-based decisions.
<li>Emphasize effective written and oral communication of results from data, with attention to the scope and limitations of conclusions.
<li>Focus on conceptual understanding rather than algebraic manipulation and formulas.
<li>Integrate real data with a context and purpose throughout the course. Select data that are meaningful and engaging to the students.
</ol>


##

<ol start = "5">
<li>Encourage multivariable thinking.
<li>Incorporate software/apps to explore concepts and work with data.
<li>Emphasize responsible and ethical conduct in the collection and use of data and in their analysis.
<li>Employ evidence-based pedagogies that actively engage students in the learning process.
<li>Use a variety of formative and summative assessments to improve teaching and learning.
<li>Implement inclusive strategies that create learning environments where all students are valued.
</ol>

Our primary textbook, [Introduction to Modern Statistics (2e)](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/) by Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel and Johanna Hardin, aligns with GAISE, as do our course learning goals. **See the syllabus!**


## Course Assessments

* **DataCamp (20%):** online tutorials to teach coding/concepts
* **Homework (10%):** primarily problems from the textbook
* **Data Labs (20%):** applied data analysis exercises using `R`
* **Project (15%):** group data analysis project/presentation
* **Exams (30%):** take-home midterm and final exam
* **Ethics (5%):** online human research ethics course

Written work typically will be completed using R Markdown, with `R` and LaTeX code as needed. We will use Appalachian's **RStudio** server in class, as well as other selected technology. 

<hr>

Additional details are provided in the syllabus and on AsULearn.


## Private Forums

Except for extreme emergencies, all written communication must be handled through your <mark>**Private Forum**</mark> on AsULearn. This will be new for most of you. 

I prefer this method because it stores all exchanges in a place where we can easily access them all semester long and it keeps my class communications separate from the rest of my email (which can turn into a black hole).

```{r}

<p style = "text-align: center;">Let's go to AsULearn and take a look!</p>

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/datacamplogonew.png", dpi = 300)
```

<p>[DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com) is a platform for learning data science and statistics. The courses present concepts and R coding using short videos and hands-on-the-keyboard exercises, with hints and feedback on each exercise. You can learn from your mistakes and revise your work until you solidify and succeed.</p>

<p>[From the American Statistical Association](http://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2015/10/01/asa-statement-on-the-role-of-statistics-in-data-science/): “Statistical education and training must continue to evolve…”</p>

<p>We will use DataCamp to learn and practice some fundamental R programming and data analysis concepts. This is how I initially learned many of my R programming skills.


## Access DataCamp

* Create a [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) account using your Appalachian email.

* In Account Settings, add your first/last names for the roster.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/datacampsettings.png", dpi = 120)
```

* Join our DataCamp class using the link provided on AsULearn.

You will have six months of free access to all DataCamp content.

## Active vs. Passive Learning

Be an active participant and take charge of your own learning!

When allowed (which is most assignments), teach and learn from your classmates.

Most real-life projects are *not* solo ventures; they're accomplished via teamwork.

You won't be alone in this class unless you choose to be. *Please don't do that.*

Listening/reading are *receptive* &rarr; speaking/ writing are *productive*.
