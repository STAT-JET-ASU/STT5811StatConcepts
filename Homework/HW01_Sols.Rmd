# Instructions

Do exercises 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8 in [**IMS2E Section 1.4**](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/data-hello#sec-chp1-exercises) and all even-numbered exercises in [**IMS2E Section 2.5**](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/data-design#sec-chp2-exercises). Use complete sentences and explain your answers for those questions where you are asked to do so.

# Section 1.4 Exercises

## Exercise 1

The dataset has 23 observations and 7 variables.

## Exercise 2

The dataset has 19,961 observations and 9 variables.

## Exercise 4

a. The research question is: “Does explicitly telling children not to cheat affect whether or not they cheat?” (Variations on this wording are possible/acceptable, as long as the meaning is the same.)

b. The subjects are 160 children between the ages of 5 and 15.

c. There are four variables in this study: (1) age (continuous numerical), (2) sex (categorical), (3) whether or not they are an only child (categorical), and (4) whether or not they cheated (categorical).

## Exercise 6

a. The research question is: “Is there a difference in unethical behavior between people who self-identify as having low social class versus high social class?”

b. The cases are 129 University of California at Berkeley undergraduates.

c. Two variables are: (1) social-class rank (categorical) and (2) number of candies taken
(discrete numerical).

## Exercise 8

a. The percent of treatment group participants who reported improvement is 66/85 = 0.776 = 77.6%.

b. The percent of control group participants who reported improvement is 65/81 = 0.802 = 80.2%.

c. There was a (slightly) higher percentage of improvement in the control group.

d. Even if the two treatments were equally effective, it is unlikely that we would observe *exactly* the same improvement rates in the two groups. The difference of 2.6%, which equates to only about one or two participants, seems like it could be due to just random chance.

e. The explanatory variable is the type of treatment the participant received (antibiotics or placebo). The response variable is improvement in sinusitis symptoms.

# Section 2.5 Exercises

## Exercise 2

The population mean is 5.5 hours and the sample mean is 6.25 hours.

## Exercise 4

a. The population of interest is all children aged 5 and 15. The sample is 160 children in this age group.

b. It is unlikely that the participants are a random sample from the population, so the results are probably not generalizable. This study is an experiment, so if participants were randomly assigned to treatment groups (no cheating or no instructions), the findings can be used to establish causal relationships. 

## Exercise 6

a. The actual population of interest is probably people in general. However, since the sample consists of 129 UC Berkeley undergraduates, the target population is limited to UC Berkeley undergraduates.

b. If the students in this sample (who are likely not randomly sampled) can be considered representative of UC Berkeley undergraduates, then the results are generalizable to the UC Berkeley undergraduate population. If students from this school can be considered representative of all college students, or all people, we could generalize to these populations as well. However, being representative of all people is quite unlikely. The study is observational (participants were not randomly assigned to lower and upper class groups), so the findings cannot be used to establish causal relationships.

## Exercise 8

a. The percentage of all videos on YouTube that are cat videos is the population parameter.

b. The value 2% is a sample statistic.

c. A video in the sample is an observation.

d. Whether or not a video is a cat video is a variable.

## Exercise 10

a. This is an observational study.

b. To ensure that students from each year are fairly represented, we could use a stratified random sample. For example, we could randomly choose a fixed number of students from each part of campus (east and west), since different class years reside in different parts. We could also select a fixed number of students from each of the four class years, but this might be more challenging.

## Exercise 12

a. This is an observational study.

b. Since the study is observational, we cannot infer causation.

c. Caffeine and lack of sleep are potential confounding variables that might explain the observed relationship between stress and muscle cramps. Students could be getting muscle cramps from increased caffeine consumption and/or lack of sleep, rather than directly from stress.

## Exercise 14

Sampling from the phone book would introduce bias since it would not include unlisted phone numbers or cell phone numbers. If these numbers are missing at random, it might not be too much of a problem. However, but if people who choose to not list their numbers share a certain characteristic, the sample would not fairly capture such people and therefore would not be representative of the population.

## Exercise 16

a. This is an observational study.

b. The friend's statement is not justified because it implies a causal association between sleep disorders and bullying, which we cannot infer from an observational study. However, it is reasonable to say that the variables are related. A better statement about this might be: “School children identified as bullies are more likely to suffer from sleep disorders than children not identified as bullies.”

## Exercise 18

The estimate will be biased and tend to overestimate the true family size. Families without children have zero probability of being sampled using the proposed strategy. If a family has two children, it is twice as likely to be sampled as a family that has one child, since there are twice as many children available. Increasingly larger families will have a proportionally larger chance of being sampled.

## Exercise 20

a. This is an experiment, since the researchers randomly assigned different treatments to the participants.

b. The explanatory variable is the Vitamin C treatment, which has four levels: 1g, 3g, 3g with additives, or placebo. The response variable is the duration of the cold. 

c. The participants were blinded, since they did not know which treatment they received.

d. The study was double-blind with respect to the researchers who were assessing the participants, but the nurses who interacted with participants during the distribution of the medication were not blinded. 

e. Participants were randomly and blinded, so we would expect about an equal number in each group to not to take their pills. Thus, non-adherence would not be a confounding variable in the study.

## Exercise 22

Recruit participants and randomly assign them to three treatment groups: no music, instrumental music, and music with lyrics. Have each person read a passage to learn a new concept, then give them each the same quiz to assess what they learned. Compare the number of questions they get correct (on average) across the three groups. (This is only one example. The important aspects are that the treatment groups are the music, the participants learn something, and the amount they learn is assessed as the response variable. Random selection of participants is not feasible, but random assignment should be used.)

## Exercise 24

a. This is an experiment.

b. The treatment group is exercise twice a week and the control group is no exercise.

c. Yes, the study uses blocking. The blocking variable is age group (18-30, 31-40, 41-55).

d. The study is not blinded. Patients definitely will know whether or not they are exercising.

e. This is an experiment, so we can make causal inferences. Since the sample is random, the causal statement can be generalized to the population at large. However, we should be cautious about any causal statement, because there may be a placebo effect (the participants are not blinded).

f. We cannot ethically require any randomly selected people to be participants in a study.

## Exercise 26

a. This is a simple random sample (SRS). Generally, the SRS method is effective in achieving a sample that is representative of the population. However, given the broad diversity (variability) in neighborhoods, in this case it might miss some neighborhoods with distinct characteristics.

b. This is a stratified random sample. It would be an effective method, given the neighborhood variability. The sample will include representation from each neighborhood. However, it requires more work.

c. This is a cluster sample. It would *not* be an effective method, given the variability. Clusters should be similar to one another and the population as a whole. The sample definitely would exclude many neighborhoods with distinct characteristics, and thus not be representative.

d. This is a multi-stage sample. It is based on a cluster sample, and therefore it has the same flaws.

e. This is a convenience sample. It is not an effective method. Houses that are not close to the city council offices have zero probability of being chosen. It likely would represent only one neighborhood. 

## Exercise 28

a. The explanatory variable is the percent of the population that has a bachelor’s degree. The response variable is per capita income (in thousands). In a scatterplot, we typically think of the response variable (Y) as being a function of the explanatory variable (X).

b. There is a strong positive linear relationship between the variables. As the percent of the population with a bachelor’s degree increases, the per capita income increases. There are very few counties where more than 60% of the population have a bachelor’s degree and very few countries that have a more than $50,000 in per capita income (upper right of the plot).

c. This is an observational study, so we cannot make a causal statement using these data. However, we can reasonably say that having a higher percent of the population with bachelor’s degree is associated with having a higher per capita income (positive association).


## Exercise 30

a. This is an observational study.

b. The explanatory variables are screen time, the child’s sex and age, and the mother’s education, ethnicity, psychological distress, and employment.

c. The response variable is psychological well-being.

d. The data come from a "nationally representative" sample, so results can be generalized to the population.

e. Because this is an observational study, the results cannot be used to establish any causal relationships.
